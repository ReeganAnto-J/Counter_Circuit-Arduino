## A basic electrionic counter circuit

#### Introduction:
A simple electrical ciruit built on Wokwi simulator.

In this project, I have combined a binary counter which can count till 16 and a decimal counter (which is limited to count till 16) all on my own.
This project was made with no other references and just to test my understanding of the basics of arduino.

#### Key skills I applied in this project (In my humble opinion):
- Circuit Design
- Binary Counter
- Decimal Counter
- Header files
- Procedural programming
- Arduino device
- Optimization
